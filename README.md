Atom package for syntax highlighting of CSPro code.

## What is CSPro?
Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) is a Windows and Android program for collecting and processing census and survey data.

## Warning
This package is unstable and was developed so that I had something slightly easier to work with than plain text. I don't guarantee that it will work well or deal with any edge cases.

**Please don't rely on it for anything important.**
